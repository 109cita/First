# First
I think that I might be starting to get this program.  It's been a bit of a challenge so far.

I am rather older than your average college student, I would say.
My first grandson is old enough for college, if that is any sign.
I was born and raised in Connecticut, but married and traveled around since my husband was a carreer Air Force man.
I am, however, back in Connecticut, home in my beloved wooded hills.
My Mom joined pathways with me but she'll turn 100 in a few months, so she's no longer taking courses.
I'll be studying TESOL, Teaching English as a Second or Other Language.
I love languages, so this should be a great course of study for me.
I look forward to meeting all sorts of interesting people.

Wish me luck.
